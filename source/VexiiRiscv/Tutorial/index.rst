=======================
Self Contained Tutorial
=======================

In this tutorial you will:

* Write some assembly
* Assemble (compile) it
* Add a bug
* Run your code in a simulator
* Debug the bug
* Learn how to show important signals from the wave
* Fix the bug

Tooling
=======

You have two options for getting start:

* You can use the Docker image with all the dependencies preinstalled
* You can use the How To Use guide on how to install all the stuff you need locally on your machine

Assembler
=========

Looking at examples
-------------------

In case you haven't done so, you should bring your repo up to speed and init+update all the submodules

.. code-block:: bash

    cd VexiiRiscv
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive 

After that you can find many test programs in `ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal`, mostly written in assembly. For instance : 

- simdAdd : is used to test a custom instruction which implements 4 bytes adder in a single instruction
- pmp : is used to test the RISC-V PMP, which allows the machine mode to restrict memory accesses of the supervisor/user mode to specific ranges (Physical Memory Protection)
- machine_vexii : is used to test most of the RISC-V machine mode privileged spec, as for instance, unaligned memory load exception, ...

Writing tests in assembly is often the only viable way to test low level features for a few reasons : 

- It avoid all the noise which would come from C/C++ languages. 
- It allows to restrict the features of the CPU being used in the tests, which is very useful for bring up.
- It allows to create very precise sequences of instructions, allowing you to trigger specific corner cases

Write the assembler code
-------------------------

So first of all, create a folder in your repository root ("/work" inside the Docker environment, or otherwise simply VexiiRiscv. The folder you cloned the repository into) called "mytest"... basically

.. code-block:: bash

    cd VexiiRiscv
    mkdir -p mytest/src
    cd mytest

or in Docker

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /work
    mkdir -p mytest/src
    cd mytest
    

then create an assembler file inside the src folder called "crt.S" containing the following code

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
      li x1, 42 // Write the literal value 42 in the integer register x1

Build the assembler Code
------------------------

Now, it's time to create a GNU make file, using the NaxSoftware infrastructure,
so that we can turn our assembly code.

In the mytest folder, create a Makefile file containing the following

.. code-block:: make

    PROJ_NAME=mytest
    STANDALONE=../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal
    include ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/asm.mk

After running make in your bash shell respectively Cygwin shell (assuming you have installed everything),
you should now be able to find a folder named "build", containing a bin file, and asm file and most importantly
the ELF and map file.

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/mytest> ls build/
    mytest.asm  mytest.bin  mytest.elf  mytest.map

In short, here is what those files are for : 

- mytest.elf : This is the primary output of the compiler, it contains all the information about our compiled program (instruction, data, symbol locations, ..). If you need to backup a compiled program, backup this file, as all 3 others (bin/asm/map) files are generated from this elf.
- mytest.bin : Raw binary file of your program. In our case, if this binary file was directly loaded in the memory at the reset vector of the CPU (0x80000000), we would be good to go.
- mytest.asm : A text file which tells you the every instructions contained in your compiled program, as well as their location in the memory space, which is quite useful when you debug the CPU itself.
- mytest.map : Specify the memory location of every section/symbol/variable of your program. Not so useful in general, but can allow to track the access to specific memory variables from a waveform.


Initial run (Error)
-------------------

In order to run the assembly code we just made, we have to tell sbt to load our ELF file into the VexiiRiscv simulator by running the following command in the root source folder (/work respectively VexiiRiscv)

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ..
    sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf mytest/build/mytest.elf --trace-all"

Here are what the options are for : 

- --with-rvm : Will turn on the RISC-V RVM extensions, allowing the execution of mul/div instruction.
- --allow-bypass-from=0 : Will enable the execute pipeline to forward results from the ALU back to new instruction before they committed, 
  so you can execute ALU instruction back to back, even when they depend on each others.
- --load-elf : This will ask the testbench to load the simulated memory with the content of the elf file before the CPU starts. 
  Additionally, if the testbench detect that the CPU reached the pass/fail symbols of the elf file, it will end the simulation with a success/failure event.
- --trace-all : This will ask the simulation to capture a whole set of simulation traces that you can find in `simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test`, including the simulation waveform (wave.fst),
  a representation of the CPU pipeline status (konata.log).

Keep in mind, by default, VexiiRiscv is configured with most of its features disabled. no branch prediction, no cache, no mmu, no ...

Now it's running

.. image:: Screenshot_20241205_142640.png


But... ooopsie. It failed.

.. image:: Screenshot_20241205_142659.png

**Question:** Why??

**Answer** The CPU is locked into a `illegal instruction exception` loop of doom.

Here is the full sc√©nario : 

- Once the CPU had executed `li x1, 42`, it then reach a portion of memory which isn't loaded with code but instead has a random value (the testbench is designed that way). 
- So it is very likely that the CPU try to execute a portion of memory which isn't recognized as an instruction, which produce a `illegal instruction exception`.
- This results into the CPU jumping to its trap vector (mtvec).
- This trap vector being initialized by the CPU reset to 0, will make the CPU jump/trap to PC=0
- At PC=0 there is as well some random values, which likely will produce another `illegal instruction exception`, again and again, forever.
- Then, the testbench detect that the CPU isn't doing any `commit` anymore (forward progress) and call it a failure.

Fixing the Error
----------------

We can fix this error quickly by adding those two additional lines to our assembler file

.. code-block:: nasm
    
    pass:
      j pass

Which results in the following code

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
      li x1, 42 // Write the value 42 in the register x1
    pass:
      j pass   

After that we run the make/sbt command again.

Now the simulation won't fail anymore, and exit gracefully, as the testbench will detect that the CPU reached the `pass` symbol.

However, an endless loop which doesn't anything isn't very useful.

Note, running SBT every time with `sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench ...` is slow and painful. What you can do instead is just to run the `sbt` command without arguments, which will bring you in the SBT shell, and there you can run your `Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench ...` with much less overhead.


The assembler "hello world"
---------------------------

Since we can't really print out a "hello world" in this context because we're simulating a CPU
and the execution of assembler code on it, we go for the next best thing: a "for" loop


.. code-block:: c

    uint32_t sum = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        sum = sum + i;
    }

As RISC-V assembly this looks like that:

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:

        li a0, 0 # Initialize sum
        li t0, 0 # counter start value
        li t1, 5 # counter end value

    sum_loop:
        bge t0, t1, pass # i == 5
        add a0, a0, t0
        addi t0, t0, 1
        j sum_loop

    pass:
        j pass
        
Also, note that if you are interested into more C to assembly comparison, you can use the Compiler Explorer tool. Here is an example : 

https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:___c,selection:(endColumn:2,endLineNumber:7,positionColumn:2,positionLineNumber:7,selectionStartColumn:2,selectionStartLineNumber:7,startColumn:2,startLineNumber:7),source:'int+miaou()%7B%0A++++int+count+%3D+1000%3B%0A++++while(count+!!%3D+0)%7B%0A++++++++asm(%22nop%22)%3B%0A++++++++count--%3B%0A++++%7D%0A%7D'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'C+source+%231',t:'0')),k:44.29215489283432,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:rv32-cgcctrunk,filters:(b:'0',binary:'1',binaryObject:'0',commentOnly:'0',debugCalls:'1',demangle:'0',directives:'0',execute:'1',intel:'0',libraryCode:'0',trim:'1',verboseDemangling:'0'),flagsViewOpen:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:2,lang:___c,libs:!(),options:'-O3',overrides:!(),selection:(endColumn:5,endLineNumber:10,positionColumn:5,positionLineNumber:10,selectionStartColumn:5,selectionStartLineNumber:10,startColumn:5,startLineNumber:10),source:1),l:'5',n:'0',o:'+RISC-V+(32-bits)+gcc+(trunk)+(Editor+%231)',t:'0')),k:55.707845107165674,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4     

Note, you can see that this assembly example use register names as a0, t1, while the previous example was using x1. RISC-V has two why of naming the registers : 

- Via their `raw name` : x0, x1, x2, ..., x31
- Via their `ABI Mnemonic` : zero, ra, sp, gp, tp, t0-t6, s0-s11, a0-a7

All of this is defined the RISC-V ABI register conventions (https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#register-convention), and GCC supports both.
So, in general, if you write low level assembly tests, you can go for the `raw name`, else just go with the `ABI Mnemonic` names.

Looking at the pipeline
-----------------------

Opening the pipeline trace (located in simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test/konata.log) using Konata , we can see that it goes five times through the loop.

.. image:: Screenshot_20241205_172115.png

Here are a few explanations how to read those Konata traces : 

- Horizontally, you have the time axes
- Vertically, you have every instruction that reached the CPU decode stage (and further).
- If on the left margin, you see some "???", it mean that you need to compile the ext/riscv-isa-sim and ext/rvls. See ext/rvls/README.md
- The reset vector of VexiiRiscv being by default 0x80000000, you can see on the top left it is where it starts.
- the A/F/D/I/E symbols represent when a given instruction is in which part of the FPU
- A : Address generation of the instruction PC
- F : Fetch, when the CPU is reading the instruction from the memory (or its cache)
- D : Decode/dispatch, when the CPU is figuring out what the instruction is about, wait until the time is right to schedule the instruction to the execute pipeline, and read the register file
- E : Execute, when the instruction is being processed.
- Instructions in vivid colors are the one which successfully executed (committed instructions)
- Instructions in dark colors are the one which failed to execute (ex : flushed by an un-predicted/miss-predicted branch/jump)

There you go. Our i < 5 condition was successfully executed

Enabling branch prediction
--------------------------

By default, the VexiiRiscv branch prediction feature is disabled. You can turn on a partial version of it on by adding `--with-btb` argument to your simulation command.

This will enable the Branch Target Buffer (BTB), which allow VexiiRiscv to predict a few things very early in the fetch pipeline, things as : 

- For a given PC, is the instruction a jump/branch ? 
- If it is, what would be its target PC ?
- If it is a branch, is it likely to be taken ?

You can observe the effects of the branch prediction easily via the Konata trace :

.. image:: Screenshot_2024-12-06_10-53-53.png

Looking at the waveform
-----------------------

Opening the simulation waveform (located in simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test/wave.fst) using gtkwave you can visualize every signals of the simulated CPU across the whole simulation.

.. image:: Screenshot_2024-12-06-10-07-10.png

So here the difficulty is to know what to look at in this ocean of wires. Here is a few tips about that.

- The WhiteboxerPlugin collects many key events from the CPU for debug purposes, in particular its whiteboxerPlugin_logic_commits signals will tell you when the CPU commits an instruction.
- DispatchPlugin_logic_candidates signals will tell you every instruction currently waiting to be dispatched to the execution pipeline, as well as their context.
- There is a few pipeline signals as : fetch_logic_ctrl, decode_ctrl execute_ctrl. Note that to know if there is a actual transaction in a given pipeline varies between the pipelines.
  For the fetch, you can probe `fetch\.*ctrl\.*_valid`, for decode it is `decode\.*LANE_SEL_\.$`, for execute it is `execute.*LANE_SEL_lane.$`. 

Introducing a bug
-----------------

Let's say you want to change the way the integer ALU is implemented, the easiest way to do so would be to modify the IntAluPlugin.scala (https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexiiRiscv/blob/977633e2866b0ab0ffbfc402b459803e2b6f8a0a/src/main/scala/vexiiriscv/execute/IntAluPlugin.scala#L72)

Lets corrupt the XOR instruction to behave like a bitwise OR : 

.. code-block:: scala

    AluBitwiseCtrlEnum.XOR  -> (srcp.SRC1 ^ srcp.SRC2),
    //into
    AluBitwiseCtrlEnum.XOR  -> (srcp.SRC1 | srcp.SRC2),

Then lets run this assembly code in the simulation : 

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
        li x1, 0x0101 // First operand
        li x2, 0x1100 // Second operand
        li x3, 0x0110 // Expected result for a xor
        xor x4, x1, x2
        bne x4, x3, fail
    pass:
        j pass
    fail:
        j fail

Then you compile the test and run it in the simulator, then, if you have ext/riscv-isa-sim and ext/rvls compiled, you should get the following testbench failure (as it should) : 

.. code-block:: 

    [Progress] Start VexiiRiscv test simulation with seed 2
    [Error] Simulation failed at time=600
    ### Stats ###
    kind :  miss / times     miss  taken
    J/B  :     0 /     0   0.0%   0.0%
      B  :     0 /     0   0.0%   0.0%
    Dispatch  0   :      36 /      44  81.8%
    Dispatch  1   :       7 /      44  15.9%
    Candidate 0   :      36 /      44  81.8%
    Candidate 1   :       7 /      44  15.9%
    Dispatch halt :       0 /      44   0.0%
    Execute  halt :       0 /      44   0.0%
    IPC           :       6 /      44  13.6%

    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: INTEGER WRITE MISSMATCH DUT=1110 REF=110
    ..

So, the interesting thing here, is that the testbench didn't failed because we reached the fail symbol, 
but because the testbench checks what is happening on every instruction committed by the CPU and detected some bad behavior.
It does that by running RVLS as a golden reference, in a lockstep manner with the simulated VexiiRiscv. 
This way, as soon as any hardware bug appear in VexiiRiscv, it is automatically caught by the testbench, and report it as an error. 
In our case, it detected that the register file was written with 0x1110 by VexiiRiscv (Device Under Test), instead of 0x0110 by RVLS (Reference).

In other words, you don't need to check that the xor instruction is executing properly by adding assembly code (bne x4, x3, fail), just executing the instruction is enough :D.
This is very very useful when you run for instance a simulation of VexiiRiscv booting linux. This take a lot of time (~20mn), and if the CPU is doing bad things, without this lock-step checking, 
it would be very very hard to figure out when things went bad for a few reasons : 

- CPU bugs may not make the software crash instantly, or at all. Symptoms and causes can be very very far apart (in time).
- Long simulation (ex booting linux) are about 400'000'000 cycles long, you can't save all of it in a wave, as that is way too much data.

Note, if you look into simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test/spike.log, you can see the riscv-isa-sim logs, which gives you a better insight about what was expected : 

.. code-block:: 

    core   0: 0x80000000 (0x000010b7) lui     ra, 0x1
    core   0: 3 0x80000000 (0x000010b7) x 1 0x00001000
    core   0: 0x80000004 (0x01008093) addi    ra, ra, 16
    core   0: 3 0x80000004 (0x01008093) x 1 0x00001010
    core   0: 0x80000008 (0x00001137) lui     sp, 0x1
    core   0: 3 0x80000008 (0x00001137) x 2 0x00001000
    core   0: 0x8000000c (0x10010113) addi    sp, sp, 256
    core   0: 3 0x8000000c (0x10010113) x 2 0x00001100
    core   0: 0x80000010 (0x11000193) li      gp, 272
    core   0: 3 0x80000010 (0x11000193) x 3 0x00000110
    core   0: 0x80000014 (0x0020c233) xor     tp, ra, sp
    core   0: 3 0x80000014 (0x0020c233) x 4 0x00000110

Experimenting with privilege levels
-----------------------------------

The RISC-V privileged specification specify 3 levels in which the CPU can be to execute code : 

- Machine mode : This is privilege level which can access everything. When the CPU get out of reset, it spawn in machine mode. Typically the machine mode will be used to run bootloaders, bios and baremetal applications.
- Supervisor mode : This is the privileged mode which would be used to run operating systems/kernels which want to take advantage of the RISC-V MMU.
- User mode : Operating systems/kernels will typically use the user mode to run applications. You can see user mode as a sandbox to avoid applications to harm things around.

So, the RISC-V privileged specification is very hard to read if you don't already have some good knowledge about what to expect.
What this example aims at doing is to show you how you can navigate your CPU between privilege modes.

.. code-block:: 

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
    #define MSTATUS_MPP_SUPERVISOR         0x00000800
    #define MSTATUS_MPP_USER               0x00000000
    #define CAUSE_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION 2

        // Specify where the CPU should jump after executing the mret instruction
        la x1, supervisor_entry; csrw mepc, x1
        // Specify where the CPU should jump when it got a interruption/exception for the machine mode
        la x1, supervisor_exit; csrw mtvec, x1
        // Specify that the CPU should go in supervisor mode after executing the mret instruction
        li x1, MSTATUS_MPP_SUPERVISOR; csrw mstatus, x1
        // Engage the privilege transition.
        mret

        // The CPU should never reach this point
        j fail

    supervisor_entry:
        //Welcome in supervisor mode :D
        li x1, 666
        // Lets run a illegal instruction, we aren't allowed to access machine mode CSR from supervisor mode !
        csrr x1, mepc
        // We should not be able to reach this point, as the previous instruction would have produce a illegal instruction exception
        j fail

    supervisor_exit:
        // Welcome back in machine mode :D
        li x1, 42
        // Lets read the CSR which indicate the reason why we back to machine mode, and check it is because of CAUSE_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION
        csrr x1, mcause
        li x2, CAUSE_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION; bne x1, x2, fail
        // lets read which instruction (PC) caused it
        csrr x1, mcause

    pass:
        j pass
    fail:
        j fail

Then, compile it, but to run it in the simulation, you will need to add the `--with-supervisor`, as the VexiiRiscv only support machine mode by default.

Here is a wave with a few key signals to figure out what the CPU is doing : 

.. image:: Screenshot-2024-12-06-20-13-17.png

Note the TrapPlugin_logic_harts_0_trap_fsm_stateReg_string signal, which is a special state machine in VexiiRiscv which is used to handle a few corner case, as interrupts, exceptions, replay of failed instructions, and a few other things.

Also, note that ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/driver/privileged.h contains a bunch of very useful macro to do similar things.


Connecting with openocd to the simulation
-----------------------------------------

Openocd is a tool generally used to connect your PC to a micro-controller and debug/reprogram it through a USB to JTAG dongle.

One interesting thing is that there is ways to simulate that jtag connection between openocd and the VexiiRiscv simulation by using a TCP connection. Here is how you can do it :

First, install openocd (a regular version should be fine)

Then, let a simulation run in one terminal with the following additional arguments `--no-probe --no-rvls-check --debug-privileged --debug-jtag-tap --jtag-remote`. Do not forget to remove the --trace-all, as it will create very big log files if you let it run long as well as slowing down the simulation.

- --no-probe : Will disable the testbench CPU inactivity watchdog (as we can stop the CPU activity totally using the jtag)
- --no-rvls-check : Will disable the RVLS golden model checking, as it isn't supported with the jtag connection yet
- --debug-privileged : Will enable the CPU debug interface as well as all the required special CSR (Control Status Register)
- --debug-jtag-tap : Will add in the CPU all the required logic to drive the CPU debug interface from a JTAG interface
- --jtag-remote : Will ask the testbench to implement the TCP to simulated JTAG bridge

Then you can start openocd via :

.. code-block:: shell
    
    (cd src/main/tcl/openocd/ && openocd -f vexiiriscv_sim.tcl)

This should give you the following message :

.. code-block:: 

    rawrr@rawrr-pc:/media/data2/proj/vexii/VexiiRiscv$ (cd src/main/tcl/openocd/ && openocd -f vexiiriscv_sim.tcl)

    Ready for Remote Connections
    Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
    Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections

Meaning that the connection is successful !

You can then connect to openocd in a few ways :

- Using GDB, which would allow you to have a fully fledge debugger
- Using telnet, to ask openocd to execute basic commands.

The issue with GDB, for very low level debugging, is that it often has a lot of overhead/noise, even for simple tasks. 
So in general using telnet is a better first step.

Here is an example of telnet connection to openocd : 

.. code-block:: 

    telnet localhost 4444
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Open On-Chip Debugger
    > 

Then you can run various commands as : 

.. code-block:: 
    
    # Read a 32 bits word at the address 0x80000000
    mdw 0x80000000

    # Write a 32 bits word (0x04200513, which is a "li a0, 0x42" instruction) at the address 0x80000000
    mww 0x80000000 0x04200513

    # Move the CPU PC to the instruction we just wrote at 0x80000000
    reg pc 0x80000000

    # Ask the CPU to execute a single instruction
    step

    # Read the CPU PC, it should be 0x80000004
    reg pc

    # Read the CPU register a0, it should be 0x42 (just written by the instruction we step)
    reg a0

There is plenty other commands available. For instance you could load the opensbi, device tree, linux, buildroot binary files in the memory from the JTAG, and boot linux, all from the JTAG ! (maybe not in simulation, it would take too long to load the images :D)


C code "hello world" (literally)
================================

Here's a simple example how you can use C and sim_putchar for printing out stuff directly through the simulation environment, allowing you to output debug messages from within the firmware you're developing.

Write the C code
-----------------

So first of all, create a folder in your repository root ("/work" inside the Docker environment, or otherwise simply VexiiRiscv. The folder you cloned the repository into) called "mytest"... basically

.. code-block:: bash

    cd VexiiRiscv
    mkdir -p helloworld/src
    cd helloworld

or in Docker

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /work
    mkdir -p helloworld/src
    cd helloworld
    
Create a file in src, called main.c

The content of src/main.c should look like that:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <sim.h>

    void main(){
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
            char *str = "hello world";
            while(*str) sim_putchar(*str++);
        }
    }

Compiling the Code
------------------

Now, it's time to create a GNU make file, using the NaxSoftware infrastructure,
so that we can turn our C code into an ELF file which we can load in the simulator.

In the same helloworld folder as above create a Makefile file containing the following

.. code-block:: make

    PROJ_NAME=helloworld
    STANDALONE=../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal
    SRCS =  $(wildcard src/*.c) \
            $(wildcard src/*.cpp) \
            $(wildcard src/*.S) \
            ${STANDALONE}/common/start.S
    include ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/app.mk

After running make in your bash shell respectively Cygwin shell (assuming you have installed everything),
you should now be able to find a folder named "build", containing a bin file, and asm file and most importantly
the ELF and map file.

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> make
    CC src/main.c
    CC ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S
    LD helloworld
    /opt/riscv/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-elf/13.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld: warning: build/helloworld.elf has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions
    Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
                 ram:        4848 B       256 KB      1.85%
    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> ls
    build  Makefile  src
    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> ls build/
    helloworld.asm  helloworld.bin  helloworld.elf  helloworld.map  home


Compilation error
-----------------

There might be a compilation error going somewhat like that

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> make
    CC src/fix.S
    CC ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S
    ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S: Assembler messages:
    ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S:55: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrc mstatus,x1', extension `zicsr' required
    ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S:57: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrs mstatus,x1', extension `zicsr' required


This happens because newer builds of the RISC-V toolchain have this feature disabled by default now and you've got to manually enable it,
which can easily be achieved by adding the following on line 1 of ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr
    ...


Running the code
----------------

You can now use SBT in order to run the elf file in your simulation

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ..
    sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf helloworld/build/helloworld.elf --trace-all --no-probe --debug-privileged --no-rvls-check"

This should now print 10 times "hello world" on your terminal

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv> sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf helloworld/build/helloworld.elf --trace-all --no-probe --debug-privileged --no-rvls-check"

Reading a CSR
----------------

In the CPU, there is the mcycle CSR which is a hardware counter which increment every clock cycles.
Let's say we want to print its value 10 times.

Reading a CSR (Control Status Register) in assembly is straight forward (ex : csrr x1, mstatus). But to do that in C, you need to wrap it a bit.


.. code-block:: c

    #include <sim.h>
    void main(){
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
            int value;
            asm volatile ("csrr %0,  mcycle": "=r" (value));
            sim_puthex(value);
            sim_putchar('\n');
        }
    }

Here are a few explenations :

- **asm** : To start specifying some assembly inside some C code
- **volatile** : To ensure GCC do not optimize away the given assembly code (not realy necessary in our case)
- **"csrr %0,  mcycle"** :  Read the mcycle CSR and write its value into %0, %0 refering to the value variable
- **"=r" (value)** : Define a write only output operand binded to the C "value" variable

I will not go more into the details of the GCC asm("") syntax, as i'm not good at it and it is quite complicated.

Hopefully, there is the riscv.h header you can include, which wrap all of those asm("") commands into easy to use macros :

.. code-block:: c

    #include <sim.h>
    #include <riscv.h>

    void main(){
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
            sim_puthex(csr_read(mcycle));
            sim_putchar('\n');
        }
    }

Then, running it via :

sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf helloworld/build/helloworld.elf --trace-all --no-probe --debug-privileged --no-rvls-check --performance-counters=0"

Will print the following in the terminal

.. code-block::

    [info] [Progress] Start VexiiRiscv test simulation with seed 2
    [info] 00000094
    [info] 000000a6
    [info] 000000b8
    [info] 000000ca
    [info] 000000dc
    [info] 000000ee
    [info] 00000100
    [info] 00000112
    [info] 00000124
    [info] 00000136

Note, we added the --performance-counters=0 VexiiRiscv argument, as the mcycle isn't implemented otherwise.
The RISC-V architecture specifies various 64 bits counters which aren't cheap in FPGA, so VexiiRiscv do not implement them by default.
