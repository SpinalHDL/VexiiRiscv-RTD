Self Contained Tutorial
=======================

In this tutorial you will:

* Write some assembly
* Assemble (compile) it
* Add a bug
* Run your code in a simulator
* Debug the bug
* Learn how to show important signals from the wave
* Fix the bug

Tooling
=======

You have two options for getting start:

* You can use the Docker image with all the dependencies preinstalled
* You can use the How To Use guide on how to install all the stuff you need locally on your machine

Assembler
=========

Looking at examples
-------------------

In case you haven't done so, you should bring your repo up to speed and init+update all the submodules

.. code-block:: bash

    cd VexiiRiscv
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive 

After that you can find many test programes in `ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal`, mostly written in assembly. For instance : 

- simdAdd : is used to test a custom instruction which implements 4 bytes adder in a single instruction
- pmp : is used to test the RISC-V PMP, which allows the machine mode to restrict memory accesses of the supervisor/user mode to specific ranges (Physical Memory Protection)
- machine_vexii : is used to test most of the RISC-V machine mode privilegied spec, as for instance, unaligned memory load exception, ...

Writting tests in assembly is often the only viable way to test low level features for a few reasons : 

- It avoid all the noise which would come from C/C++ languages. 
- It allow to restrict the features of the CPU being used in the tests, which is very usefull for bring up.
- It allows to create very precise sequances of instruction, allowing you to trigger specific corner cases

Write the assembler code
-------------------------

So first of all, create a folder in your repository root ("/work" inside the Docker environment, or otherwisde simply VexiiRiscv. The folder you cloned the repository into) called "mytest"... basically

.. code-block:: bash

    cd VexiiRiscv
    mkdir -p mytest/src
    cd mytest

or in Docker

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /work
    mkdir -p mytest/src
    cd mytest
    

then create an assembler file inside the src folder called "crt.S" containing the following code

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
      li x1, 42 // Write the literal value 42 in the integer register x1

Build the assembler Code
------------------------

Now, it's time to create a GNU make file, using the NaxSoftware infrastructure,
so that we can turn our assembly code.

In the mytest folder, create a Makefile file containing the following

.. code-block:: make

    PROJ_NAME=mytest
    STANDALONE=../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal
    include ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/asm.mk

After running make in your bash shell respectively Cygwin shell (assuming you have installed everything),
you should now be able to find a folder named "build", containing a bin file, and asm file and most importantly
the ELF and map file.

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/mytest> ls build/
    mytest.asm  mytest.bin  mytest.elf  mytest.map

In short, here is what those files are for : 

- mytest.elf : This is the primary output of the compiler, it contains all the informations about our compiled program (instruction, data, symbole locations, ..). If you need to backup a compiled program, backup this file, as all 3 others (bin/asm/map) files are generated from this elf.
- mytest.bin : Raw binary file of your program. In our case, if this binary file was directly loaded in the memory at the reset vector of the CPU (0x80000000), we would be good to go.
- mytest.asm : A text file which tells you the every instructions contained in your compiled program, as well as their location in the memory space, which is quite usefull when you debug the CPU itself.
- mytest.map : Specify the memory location of every section/symbol/variable of your program. Not so usefull in general, but can allow to track the access to specific memory variables from a waveform.


Initial run (Error)
-------------------

In order to run the assembly code we just made, we have to tell sbt to load our ELF file into the VexiiRiscv simulator by running the following command in the root source folder (/work respectively VexiiRiscv)

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ..
    sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf mytest/build/mytest.elf --trace-all"

Here are what the options are for : 

- --with-rvm : Will turn on the RISC-V RVM extentions, allowing the exection of mul/div instruction.
- --allow-bypass-from=0 : Will enable the execute pipeline to forward results from the ALU back to new instruction before they commited, 
  so you can execute ALU instruction back to back, even when they depend on each others.
- --load-elf : This will ask the testbench to load the simulated memory with the content of the elf file before the CPU stats. 
  Additionaly, if the testbench detect that the CPU reached the pass/fail symbols of the elf file, it will end the simulation with a success/failure event.
- --trace-all : This will ask the simulation to capture a whole set of simulation traces that you can find in `simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test`, including the simulation waveform (wave.fst),
  a representation of the CPU pipeline status (konata.log).

Keep in mind, by default, VexiiRiscv is configured with most of its features disabled. no branch prediction, no cache, no mmu, no ...

Now it's running

.. image:: Screenshot_20241205_142640.png


But... ooopsie. It failed.

.. image:: Screenshot_20241205_142659.png

**Question:** Why??

**Answer** The CPU is locked into a `illegal instruction exception` loop of doom.

Here is the full sc√©nario : 

- Once the CPU had executed `li x1, 42`, it then reach a portion of memory which isn't loaded with code but instead has a random value (the testbench is designed that way). 
- So it is very likely that the CPU try to execute a portion of memory which isn't reconized as an instruction, which produce a `illegal instruction exception`.
- This results into the CPU jumping to its trap vector (mtvec).
- This trap vector being initialized by the CPU reset to 0, will make the CPU jump/trap to PC=0
- At PC=0 there is aswell some random values, which likely will produce another `illegal instruction exception`, again and again, forever.
- Then, the testbench detect that the CPU isn't doing any `commit` anymore (forward progress) and call it a failure.

Fixing the Error
----------------

We can fix this error quickly by adding those two additional lines to our assembler file

.. code-block:: nasm
    
    pass:
      j pass

Which results in the following code

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
      li x1, 42 // Write the value 42 in the register x1
    pass:
      j pass   

After that we run the make/sbt command again.

Now the simulation won't fail anymore, and exit gracfully, as the testbench will detect that the CPU reached the `pass` symbol.

However, an endless loop which doesn't anything isn't very useful.

Note, running SBT every time with `sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench ...` is slow and painefull. What you can do instead is just to run the `sbt` command without arguments, which will bring you in the SBT shell, and there you can run your `Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench ...` with much less overhead.


The assembler "hello world"
---------------------------

Since we can't really print out a "hello world" in this context because we're simulating a CPU
and the execution of assembler code on it, we go for the next best thing: A for loop


.. code-block:: c

    uint32_t sum = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i<5; i++) {
        sum = sum + i;
    }

As RISC-V assembly this looks like that:

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:

        li a0, 0 # Initialize sum
        li t0, 0 # counter start value
        li t1, 5 # counter end value

    sum_loop:
        bge t0, t1, pass # i == 5
        add a0, a0, t0
        addi t0, t0, 1
        j sum_loop

    pass:
        j pass
        
Also, note that if you are interrested into more C to assembly comparison, you can use the Compiler Explorer tool. Here is an example : 

https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:___c,selection:(endColumn:2,endLineNumber:7,positionColumn:2,positionLineNumber:7,selectionStartColumn:2,selectionStartLineNumber:7,startColumn:2,startLineNumber:7),source:'int+miaou()%7B%0A++++int+count+%3D+1000%3B%0A++++while(count+!!%3D+0)%7B%0A++++++++asm(%22nop%22)%3B%0A++++++++count--%3B%0A++++%7D%0A%7D'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'C+source+%231',t:'0')),k:44.29215489283432,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:rv32-cgcctrunk,filters:(b:'0',binary:'1',binaryObject:'0',commentOnly:'0',debugCalls:'1',demangle:'0',directives:'0',execute:'1',intel:'0',libraryCode:'0',trim:'1',verboseDemangling:'0'),flagsViewOpen:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:2,lang:___c,libs:!(),options:'-O3',overrides:!(),selection:(endColumn:5,endLineNumber:10,positionColumn:5,positionLineNumber:10,selectionStartColumn:5,selectionStartLineNumber:10,startColumn:5,startLineNumber:10),source:1),l:'5',n:'0',o:'+RISC-V+(32-bits)+gcc+(trunk)+(Editor+%231)',t:'0')),k:55.707845107165674,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4     

Note, you can see that this assembly example use register names as a0, t1, while the previous example was using x1. RISC-V has two why of naming the registers : 

- Via their `raw name` : x0, x1, x2, ..., x31
- Via their `ABI Mnemonic` : zero, ra, sp, gp, tp, t0-t6, s0-s11, a0-a7

All of this is defined the RISC-V ABI register conventions (https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#register-convention), and GCC suports both.
So, in general, if you write lowlevel assembly tests, you can go for the `raw name`, else just go with the `ABI Mnemonic` names.

Looking at the pipeline
-----------------------

Opening the pipeline trace (located in simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test/konata.log) using Konata , we can see that it goes five times through the loop.

.. image:: Screenshot_20241205_172115.png

Here are a few explenation now to read those Konata traces : 

- Horizontally, you have the time axes
- Vertically, you have every instruction that reached the CPU decode stage (and futher).
- If on the left margin, you see some "???", it mean that you need to compile the ext/riscv-isa-sim and ext/rvls. See ext/rvls/README.md
- The reset vector of VexiiRiscv being by default 0x80000000, you can see on the top left it is where it starts.
- the A/F/D/I/E symboles represent when a given instruction is in which part of the FPU
- A : Address generation of the instruction PC
- F : Fetch, when the CPU is reading the instruction from the memory (or its cache)
- D : Decode/dispatch, when the CPU is figuring out what the instruction is about, wait until the time is right to schedule the instruction to the execute pipeline, and read the register file
- E : Execute, when the instruction is being processed.
- Instruction in vivide colors are the one which sucessfuly executed (commited instruction)
- Instruction in dark colors are the one which failed to execute (ex : flushed by an un-predicted/miss-predicted branch/jump)

There you go. Our i < 5 condition was successfully executed

Enabling branch prediction
--------------------------

By default, the VexiiRiscv branch prediction feature is disabled. You can turn on a partial version of it on by adding `--with-btb` argument to your simulation command.

This will enable the Branch Target Buffer (BTB), which allow VexiiRiscv to predict a few things very early in the fetch pipeline, things as : 

- For a given PC, is the instruction a jump/branch ? 
- If it is, what would be its target PC ?
- If it is a branch, is it likely to be taken ?

You can observe the effects of the branch prediction easily via the Konata trace :

.. image:: Screenshot_2024-12-06_10-53-53.png

Looking at the waveform
--------------------------

Opening the simulation waveform (located in simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test/wave.fst) using gtkwave you can visualize every signals of the simulated CPU across the whole simulation.

.. image:: Screenshot_2024-12-06-10-07-10.png

So here the difficulty is to know what to look at in this ocean of wires. Here is a few tips about that.

- The WhiteboxerPlugin collects many key events from the CPU for debug purposes, in particular its whiteboxerPlugin_logic_commits signals will tell you when the CPU commits an instruction.
- DispatchPlugin_logic_candidates signals will tell you every instruction currently waiting to be dispatched to the execution pipeline, aswell as their context.
- There is a few pipeline signals as : fetch_logic_ctrl, decode_ctrl execute_ctrl. Note that to know if there is a actual transaction in a given pipeline varies between the pipelines.
  For the fetch, you can probe `fetch\.*ctrl\.*_valid`, for decode it is `decode\.*LANE_SEL_\.$`, for execute it is `execute.*LANE_SEL_lane.$`. 

Introducing a bug
--------------------------

Let's say you want to change the way the integer ALU is implemented, the easiest way to do so would be to modify the IntAluPlugin.scala (https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexiiRiscv/blob/977633e2866b0ab0ffbfc402b459803e2b6f8a0a/src/main/scala/vexiiriscv/execute/IntAluPlugin.scala#L72)

Lets corrupt the XOR instruction to behave like a bitwise OR : 

.. code-block:: scala

    AluBitwiseCtrlEnum.XOR  -> (srcp.SRC1 ^ srcp.SRC2),
    //into
    AluBitwiseCtrlEnum.XOR  -> (srcp.SRC1 | srcp.SRC2),

Then lets run this assembly code in the simulation : 

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr

    .global _start
    _start:
        li x1, 0x0101 // First operand
        li x2, 0x1100 // Second operand
        li x3, 0x0110 // Expected result for a xor
        xor x4, x1, x2
        bne x4, x3, fail
    pass:
        j pass
    fail:
        j fail

Then you compile the test and run it in the simulator, then, if you have ext/riscv-isa-sim and ext/rvls compliled, you should get the following testbench failure (as it should) : 

.. code-block:: 

    [Progress] Start VexiiRiscv test simulation with seed 2
    [Error] Simulation failed at time=600
    ### Stats ###
    kind :  miss / times     miss  taken
    J/B  :     0 /     0   0.0%   0.0%
      B  :     0 /     0   0.0%   0.0%
    Dispatch  0   :      36 /      44  81.8%
    Dispatch  1   :       7 /      44  15.9%
    Candidate 0   :      36 /      44  81.8%
    Candidate 1   :       7 /      44  15.9%
    Dispatch halt :       0 /      44   0.0%
    Execute  halt :       0 /      44   0.0%
    IPC           :       6 /      44  13.6%

    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: INTEGER WRITE MISSMATCH DUT=1110 REF=110
    ..

So, the interesting thing here, is that the testbench didn't failed because we reached the fail symbol, 
but because the testbench checks what is happening on every instruction commited by the CPU and detected some bad behaviour.
It does that by running RVLS as a golden reference, in a lockstep manner with the simulated VexiiRiscv. 
This way, as soon as any hardware bug appear in VexiiRiscv, it is automaticaly catched by the testbench, and report it as an error. 
In our case, it detected that the register file was written with 0x1110 by VexiiRiscv (Device Under Test), instead of 0x0110 by RVLS (Reference).

In other words, you don't need to check that the xor instruction is executing properly by adding assembly code (bne x4, x3, fail), just executing the instruction is enough :D.
This is very very usefull when you run for instance a simulation of VexiiRiscv booting linux. This take a lot of time (~20mn), and if the CPU is doing bad things, without this lock-step checking, 
it would be very very hard to figure out when things went bad for a few reasons : 

- CPU bugs may not make the software crash instantly, or at all. Symptoms and causes can be very very far apparts (in time).
- Long simulation (ex booting linux) are about 400'000'000 cycles long, you can't save all of it in a wave, as that is way too much data.

Note, if you look into simWorkspace/VexiiRiscv/test/spike.log, you can see the riscv-isa-sim logs, which gives you a better insight about what was expected : 

.. code-block:: 

    core   0: 0x80000000 (0x000010b7) lui     ra, 0x1
    core   0: 3 0x80000000 (0x000010b7) x 1 0x00001000
    core   0: 0x80000004 (0x01008093) addi    ra, ra, 16
    core   0: 3 0x80000004 (0x01008093) x 1 0x00001010
    core   0: 0x80000008 (0x00001137) lui     sp, 0x1
    core   0: 3 0x80000008 (0x00001137) x 2 0x00001000
    core   0: 0x8000000c (0x10010113) addi    sp, sp, 256
    core   0: 3 0x8000000c (0x10010113) x 2 0x00001100

    core   0: 3 0x80000010 (0x11000193) x 3 0x00000110
    core   0: 0x80000014 (0x0020c233) xor     tp, ra, sp
    core   0: 3 0x80000014 (0x0020c233) x 4 0x00000110

C code "hello world" (literally)
=================================

Here's a simple example how you can use C and sim_putchar for printing out stuff directly through the simulation environment, allowing you to output debug messages from within the firmware you're developing.

Write the C code
-----------------

So first of all, create a folder in your repository root ("/work" inside the Docker environment, or otherwisde simply VexiiRiscv. The folder you cloned the repository into) called "mytest"... basically

.. code-block:: bash

    cd VexiiRiscv
    mkdir -p helloworld/src
    cd helloworld

or in Docker

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /work
    mkdir -p helloworld/src
    cd helloworld
    
Create a file in src, called main.c

The content of src/main.c should look like that:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <sim.h>

    void main(){
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
            char *str = "hello world";
            while(*str) sim_putchar(*str++);
        }
    }

Compiling the Code
------------------

Now, it's time to create a GNU make file, using the NaxSoftware infrastructure,
so that we can turn our c code into an ELF file which we can load in the simulator.

In the same helloworld folder as above create a Makefile file containing the following

.. code-block:: make

    PROJ_NAME=helloworld
    STANDALONE=../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal
    SRCS =  $(wildcard src/*.c) \
            $(wildcard src/*.cpp) \
            $(wildcard src/*.S) \
            ${STANDALONE}/common/start.S
    include ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/app.mk

After running make in your bash shell respectively Cygwin shell (assuming you have installed everything),
you should now be able to find a folder named "build", containing a bin file, and asm file and most importantly
the ELF and map file.

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> make
    CC src/main.c
    CC ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S
    LD helloworld
    /opt/riscv/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-elf/13.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld: warning: build/helloworld.elf has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions
    Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
                 ram:        4848 B       256 KB      1.85%
    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> ls
    build  Makefile  src
    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> ls build/
    helloworld.asm  helloworld.bin  helloworld.elf  helloworld.map  home


Compilation error
-----------------

There might be a compilation error going somewhat like that

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv/helloworld> make
    CC src/fix.S
    CC ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S
    ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S: Assembler messages:
    ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S:55: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrc mstatus,x1', extension `zicsr' required
    ../ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S:57: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrs mstatus,x1', extension `zicsr' required


This happens because newer builds of the RISC-V toolchain have this feature disabled by default now and you've got to manually enable it,
which can easily be achieved by adding the following on line 1 of ext/NaxSoftware/baremetal/common/start.S

.. code-block:: nasm

    .option arch, +zicsr
    ...


Running the code
----------------

You can now use SBT in order to run the elf file in your simulation

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ..
    sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf helloworld/build/helloworld.elf --trace-all --no-probe --debug-privileged --no-rvls-check"

This should now print 10 times "hello world" on your terminal

.. code-block::

    leviathan@harvey:~/VexiiRiscv> sbt "Test/runMain vexiiriscv.tester.TestBench --with-rvm --allow-bypass-from=0 --load-elf helloworld/build/helloworld.elf --trace-all --no-probe --debug-privileged --no-rvls-check"
