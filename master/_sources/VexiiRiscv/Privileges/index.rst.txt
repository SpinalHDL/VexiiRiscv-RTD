Privileges
###################

RISC-V specifies in "Volume 2, Privileged Specification" most of its special registers (CSR) which allows to handle things as :

- Traps (interrupts + exceptions)
- Memory protections (MMU, PMP)
- Privilege modes (Machine, Superivisor, User)

A microcontroller will typicaly only need Machine mode, maybe User mode, while a Linux capable CPU will normaly need them all.

- Machine mode : Baremetal / Bootloader / BIOS / OpenSBI / RTOS
- Supervisor mode : Kernel / Linux
- User mode : Applications running on the top of linux

Those are handled in VexiiRiscv via a sets of plugins.

CsrAccessPlugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implement the CSR read and write instruction in the execute pipeline
- Provide an API for other plugins to specify the mapping between the CSR registers and the CSR instruction

For instance, when another plugin want to add a custom CSR, it can do as follow :

.. code-block:: scala

    class CustomPlugin() extends FiberPlugin  {
      val logic = during setup new Area{
        val cp = host[CsrService] // CsrAccessPlugin is an implementation of CsrService
        val buildBefore = retains(cp.csrLock) // This ensure that the CsrService hold one until we are finished with the API usages
        awaitBuild()

        // Define a few registers
        val regX = Reg(UInt(8 bits)) init(0)
        val regY = Reg(UInt(8 bits)) init(0)

        // Map those registers in the RISC-V CSRs at address 0xFF0.
        // - Bits 17:10 will be regX
        // - Bits 27:20 will be regY
        cp.readWrite(0xFF0, 10 -> regX, 20 -> regY)

        // Now that we are with the csr API, we allows it to elaborate
        buildBefore.release()
      }
    }

PrivilegedPlugin
----------------

- Implement the RISC-V privileged spec, mostly by using the CsrAccessPlugin API
- Use the CsrRamPlugin to implement various CSR as MTVAL, MTVEC, MEPC, MSCRATCH, ...
- By default only the machine mode is enabled.
- You can use `--with-supervisor` and --with-user` to enable the corresponding privileged modes

CsrRamPlugin
------------

- Provide an API which allows to statically allocate space on it
- Provide an API to create read / write ports on it
- Used by various plugins to store the CSR contents in a FPGA efficient way


TrapPlugin
-----------

- Implement the trap buffer / FSM
- The FSM implement the core logic of many special instructions (MRET, SRET, ECALL, EBREAK, FENCE.I, WFI, ...)
- Also allows the CPU pipeline to emit hardware traps to re-execute (REDO) the current instruction
  or to jump to the next one after a full pipeline flush (NEXT).
- the REDO hardware trap is used by I$ D$ miss, the DecodePlugin when it detect a illegal branch prediction
- the NEXT hardware trap is used by the CsrAccessPlugin when a state change require a full CPU flush

PerformanceCounterPlugin
------------------------

Implement the privileged performance counters in a FPGA friendly way :

- Use the CsrRamPlugin to store 57 bits for each performance counter
- Use a dedicated 7 bits hardware register per counter
- Once that 7 bits register MSB is set, a FSM will flush it into the CsrRamPlugin
- By default, this plugins is disabled, to enable it, you can use, for instance, `--performance-counters 9`

EnvPlugin
---------

- Implement a few instructions as MRET, SRET, ECALL, EBREAK, FENCE.I, WFI by producing hardware traps
- Those hardware trap are then handled in the TrapPlugin FSM

MmuPlugin
---------

- Implements supervisor mode memory protections
- Include a hardware page walker
- Has a TLB to store the page walker results
- TLB are stored in multiples directly mapped memories. Typicaly 2 way x 32 TLB for 4KB pages + 1 way x 32 TLB for mega pages
- Map very well with FPGA which supports asyncronous read memory (LUT based RAM)
- Can be configured to work with syncronous read memory (block ram), but will likely be your critical path for timings

This plugin is enabled via `--with-mmu` or `--with-supervisor`

PmpPlugin
----------

- Allows the machine mode to restrict memory accesses of the supervisor/user mode to specific ranges (Physical Memory Protection)
- Quite expensive in resources and timings.
- Support NAPOT (aligned power of 2 sized regions)
- Support TOR (unrestricted region address/size)
- You can disable the RISC-V TOR support to help with area and timings
- You can set the granularity of the memory regions (to improve timings and area usage). This throw away some of the address LSB bits.
  By default, the granularity is 4KB (--pmp-granularity=4096). Minimum allowed is 4.
- By default, the PmpPlugin is disabled, but you can enable it via, for instance, `--pmp-size=4`,
  which will enable 4 hardware PMP registres, allowing you to set up to 4 memory regions.
