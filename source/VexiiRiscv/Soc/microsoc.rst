MicroSoc
--------

MicroSoC is a little SoC based on VexiiRiscv and a tilelink interconnect.

Its goals are :

- To provide a simple reference design
- To be a simple and light FPGA SoC
- Target a high frequency of operation, but not a high IPC (by default)

Here is a architecture diagram :

Here you can see the default vexiiriscv architecture for this SoC :

.. image:: /asset/picture/microsoc_vexii.png

You can find its implementation here https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexiiRiscv/blob/dev/src/main/scala/vexiiriscv/soc/micro

- MicroSoc.scala : Contains the SoC toplevel
- MicroSocGen.scala : Contains the scala main which can be used to generate the SoC verilog
- MicroSocSim.scala : Contains a simple SpinalSim testbench for the SoC

The MicroSoC code is commented in a way which should help non-initiated to understand what is happening. (this is an invitation to read the code ^^)

Verilog generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate the SoC verilog, you can run :

.. code:: shell

    # Default configuration
    sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocGen"
    # SoC with 32 KB + RV32IMC running at 50 Mhz:
    sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocGen --ram-bytes=32768 --with-rvm --with-rvc --system-frequency=50000000"
    # List all the parameters available
    sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocGen --help"

Simulation (SpinalSim / Verilator)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have Verilator installed, you can run a simulation by doing :

.. code:: shell

    # Default configuration
    sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocSim"
    # List all the parameters available
    sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocSim --help"

While the simulation is running you can connect to it using openocd as if it was real hardware :

.. code:: shell

    openocd -f src/main/tcl/openocd/vexiiriscv_sim.tcl

Adding a custom peripheral
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say you want to design a peripheral and then add it to the SoC, the MicroSoc contains one example of that via PeripheralDemo.scala :

https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexiiRiscv/blob/dev/src/main/scala/vexiiriscv/soc/micro/PeripheralDemo.scala

This peripheral example is a very simple one which provide the CPU access to leds, buttons and an interrupt function of the buttons value.

.. image:: /asset/picture/peripheral_demo.png

You can see in the diagram above :

- PeripheralDemo : Which is our custom peripheral in its traditional sense (a hardware Component / Module). It use regular SpinalHDL stuff.
- mapper : This is a tool which ease the creation of peripherals register file.
  Instead of having stuff like big switch case on the bus address, you just need to say "Create a RW register at this address" in a more natural language.
- BufferCC : Used to avoid metastability when we use the buttons value in our hardware (this is a chain of 2 flip-flop)
- PeripheralDemoFiber : This is sort of the integration layer for our PeripheralDemo into a SoC. This serve a few purposes.
  It handle the Tilelink parameters negotiation / propagation, aswell as exporting the leds and buttons directly to the MicroSoc io.
- Node : This is an instance of the tilelink bus in our SoC. It is used for parameter negotiation/propagation as well as to get the hardware bus instance.

You can then add that peripheral in the toplevel by :

.. code:: scala

      val demo = new PeripheralDemoFiber(new PeripheralDemoParam(12,16))
      demo.node at 0x10002000 of bus32
      plic.mapUpInterrupt(2, demo.interrupt)

This peripheral is already integrated into MicroSoC as a demo but disabled by default. To enable it, will need to provide a specific command line parameter. For instance :

sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocSim --demo-peripheral leds=16,buttons=12"
