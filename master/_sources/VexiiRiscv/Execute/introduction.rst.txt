Introduction
==============================

The execute pipeline has the following properties : 

- Support multiple lane of execution.
- Support multiple implementation of the same instruction on the same lane (late-alu) via the concept of "layer"
- each layer is owned by a given lane
- each layer can implement multiple instructions and store a data model of their requirements.
- The whole pipeline never collapse bubbles, all lanes of every stage move forward together as one. 
- Elements of the pipeline are allowed to stop the whole pipeline via a shared freeze interface.


Here is a class diagram :

The main thing about it is that for every uop implementation in the pipeline, there is the elaboration time information for : 

- How/where to retreive the result of the instruction (rd)
- From which point in the pipeline it use which register file (rs)
- From which point in the pipleine the instruction can be considered as done (completion)
- Until which point in the pipeline the instruction may flush younger instructions (mayFlushUpTo)
- From which point in the pipeline the instruction should not be flushed anymore because it already had produced side effects (dontFlushFrom)
- The list of decoded signals/values that the instruction is using (decodings)

The idea is that with all those information, the ExecuteLanePlugin and DispatchPlugin DecodePlugin are able to generate the proper logics to generate a functional pipeline / dispatch / decoder with no hand written hardcoded hardware.
