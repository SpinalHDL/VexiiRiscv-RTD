JTAG
====

VexiiRiscv support debugging by implementing the official RISC-V debug spec.

- Compatible with OpenOCD (and maybe some other closed vendor, but untested)
- Can be used through a regular JTAG interface
- Can be used via tunneling through a single JTAG TAP instruction (FPGA native jtag interface)
- Support for some hardware trigger (PC, Load/Store address)
